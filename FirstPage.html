                <p>Pair'Em is a platform built around the goal of making education more accessible to the general public. 
                As a group of computer science and engineering students at Santa Clara University, we came together 
                with the intention of making an app that can help people. Considering the lack of accessibility to 
                healthcare, education, and resources in America, we decided upon a platform that increased accessibility 
                all three, with no cost to the user. Pair'Em's purpose is to connect people in need of general advice to 
                undergrad and grad students, majoring in the area of expertise. This offers up-to-date information from 
                credible college students to people looking for free advice. Additionally, it gives students the 
                opportunity to tackle some un-billed practice hours in the industry they will be entering after graduation.
